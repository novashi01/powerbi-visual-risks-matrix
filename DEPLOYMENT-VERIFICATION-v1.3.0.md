## 🧪 Dual Layout Settings Testing

### Matrix Grid Settings Test
- [ ] **Format Panel**: "Matrix Grid" section appears
- [ ] **Grid Rows**: Slider/input from 2-10 (default: 3)
- [ ] **Grid Columns**: Slider/input from 2-10 (default: 3)  
- [ ] **Enable Scrolling**: Toggle switch (default: enabled)
- [ ] **Functionality**: Changing values updates matrix dimensions immediately

### Risk Markers Layout Settings Test
- [ ] **Format Panel**: "Risk Markers Layout" section appears separately
- [ ] **Organized Positioning**: Toggle switch (default: enabled)
- [ ] **Positioning Mode**: Dropdown with 3 options:
  - "Organized grid" (default)
  - "Random scatter" 
  - "Centered"
- [ ] **Marker Spacing**: Slider/input from 0-20px (default: 5px)
- [ ] **Functionality**: Changing values updates marker arrangement immediately

## 📊 Functional Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Risk Portfolio (< 25 risks)
```
Configuration:
├── Matrix Grid: 3×3, Scrolling enabled
├── Risk Markers: Organized grid, 8px spacing
└── Expected: Clean organized layout, no scrolling needed
```
**Test Steps**:
1. Load 15-20 risk data points
2. Configure Matrix Grid to 3×3  
3. Set Risk Markers to "Organized grid"
4. Verify markers arrange neatly within cells
5. Check no scroll bars appear

### Scenario 2: Medium Risk Portfolio (25-50 risks)
```
Configuration:
├── Matrix Grid: 5×5, Scrolling enabled  
├── Risk Markers: Organized grid, 5px spacing
└── Expected: Organized layout with some scrolling
```
**Test Steps**:
1. Load 30-40 risk data points
2. Configure Matrix Grid to 5×5
3. Keep organized positioning enabled
4. Verify markers don't overlap in dense cells
5. Test scrolling if content exceeds viewport

### Scenario 3: Large Risk Portfolio (50+ risks)  
```
Configuration:
├── Matrix Grid: 7×7, Scrolling enabled
├── Risk Markers: Organized grid, 3px spacing
└── Expected: Compact organized layout with scrolling
```
**Test Steps**:
1. Load 60+ risk data points
2. Configure Matrix Grid to 7×7
3. Reduce marker spacing to 3px
4. Verify all risks visible via scrolling
5. Check performance remains smooth

### Scenario 4: Legacy Compatibility
```
Configuration:
├── Matrix Grid: 5×5, Scrolling disabled
├── Risk Markers: Random scatter, 5px spacing  
└── Expected: Traditional jittered appearance
```
**Test Steps**:
1. Load existing risk data
2. Set Matrix Grid to 5×5
3. Change positioning mode to "Random scatter"
4. Disable scrolling
5. Verify looks similar to v1.2.0 behavior

### Scenario 5: Presentation Mode
```
Configuration:
├── Matrix Grid: 4×4, Scrolling enabled
├── Risk Markers: Centered, 10px spacing
└── Expected: Clean, minimal appearance
```
**Test Steps**:
1. Load moderate risk dataset
2. Set positioning mode to "Centered"
3. Increase marker spacing to 10px
4. Verify clean, professional appearance
5. Test suitable for executive presentations

## 🔄 Interactive Testing

### Matrix Grid Changes
- [ ] **2×2 Grid**: Minimal matrix works correctly
- [ ] **3×3 Grid**: Default configuration functions properly  
- [ ] **5×5 Grid**: Standard risk matrix maintains compatibility
- [ ] **10×10 Grid**: Maximum size with scrolling enabled
- [ ] **Non-Square**: Test 3×5, 4×6 configurations
- [ ] **Dynamic Resize**: Changes apply immediately without refresh

### Risk Markers Positioning
- [ ] **Organized → Random**: Toggle between modes works
- [ ] **Random → Centered**: All positioning modes functional  
- [ ] **Spacing Changes**: Marker spacing updates immediately
- [ ] **Dense Cells**: 10+ markers in one cell organize properly
- [ ] **Single Markers**: One marker per cell positions correctly
- [ ] **Mixed Density**: Some cells dense, others sparse

## 🎨 Visual Quality Validation

### Layout Quality Checks
- [ ] **Grid Alignment**: Matrix cells align properly
- [ ] **Marker Clarity**: All risk markers clearly visible
- [ ] **Text Readability**: Labels and tooltips readable
- [ ] **Color Consistency**: Severity colors maintained across modes
