# Git Push Fix - v1.3.2

## What Happened

✅ **Good News**: Tag v1.3.2 was pushed successfully!  
⚠️ **Issue**: Your commits couldn't be pushed because GitHub has changes you don't have locally.

```
 * [new tag]         v1.3.2 -> v1.3.2  ✅ SUCCESS
 ! [rejected]        main -> main      ❌ REJECTED
```

## Solution: Pull Then Push

You need to pull the remote changes first, then push your commits.

### Option 1: Use the Fix Script (Easiest)

I've created a script that will:
1. Pull remote changes
2. Push your v1.3.2 commits
3. Verify tag is on GitHub

**Run this**:
```cmd
GIT-PULL-AND-PUSH.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands

```bash
cd "C:\Users\novas\OneDrive - Northland Regional Council\Documents\PowerBI Backup\PBI Visual\myVisual"

# Pull remote changes with rebase
git pull origin main --rebase

# Push your commits
git push origin main

# Tag is already pushed, but verify:
git push origin v1.3.2
```

---

## What the Script Does

### Step 1: Pull Remote Changes
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```
This gets the latest changes from GitHub and rebases your commits on top.

### Step 2: Push Your Commits
```bash
git push origin main
```
This pushes your v1.3.2 changes.

### Step 3: Verify Tag
The tag `v1.3.2` is already on GitHub (success!), so nothing more needed.

## Understanding the Issue

**Remote has**: Some commits you don't have locally  
**You have**: Your v1.3.2 commits  
**Git says**: "Get the remote commits first, then push yours"

This is normal when:
- Someone else pushed to the repo
- You made commits on another machine
- GitHub Actions made automated commits
- You edited files directly on GitHub

---

## Expected Result

After running the script or commands:

```
From https://github.com/novashi01/powerbi-visual-risks-matrix
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.

Enumerating objects: 145, done.
Counting objects: 100% (145/145), done.
Writing objects: 100% (145/145), done.
To https://github.com/novashi01/powerbi-visual-risks-matrix.git
   abc1234..def5678  main -> main

✅ Success! Your v1.3.2 changes are now on GitHub
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get merge conflicts:

```bash
# See which files have conflicts
git status

# Open the files and resolve conflicts (look for <<<<<<< markers)
# After fixing, mark as resolved:
git add .

# Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue

# Then push
git push origin main
```

### If rebase seems complicated:

Use merge instead of rebase:
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve any merge conflicts if they appear
git push origin main
```

### If you want to see what's different:

```bash
# See remote commits you don't have
git log HEAD..origin/main

# See your commits not on remote
git log origin/main..HEAD
```
