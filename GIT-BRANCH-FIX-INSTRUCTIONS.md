# Branch Issue Fix - v1.3.2

## The Problem

You're currently on branch: **`feature/axis-labels-complete`**  
But trying to push to: **`main`**

That's why the push failed. Git won't let you push to main when you're on a different branch.

---

## The Solution - Choose One

### Option 1: Push to Feature Branch (Quick & Safe) ‚úÖ

Push your v1.3.2 changes to the feature branch, then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/axis-labels-complete
```

**Then on GitHub**:
1. Go to https://github.com/novashi01/powerbi-visual-risks-matrix
2. You'll see a banner: "feature/axis-labels-complete had recent pushes"
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Review changes
5. Click "Merge pull request"

### Option 2: Switch to Main and Merge (Direct) üöÄ

Merge your feature branch into main and push directly.

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/axis-labels-complete

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Push tag
git push origin v1.3.2
```

## Using the Script (Easiest)

I created a script that handles both options:

```cmd
GIT-FIX-BRANCH-PUSH.bat
```

It will ask you:
1. **Option 1**: Push to feature branch ‚Üí Create PR later
2. **Option 2**: Switch to main ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Push

Just run it and choose!

## What About the Untracked Files?

```
Untracked files:
  GIT-FIX-PUSH.md
  GIT-PULL-AND-PUSH.bat
```

These are helper files I created. You can:

**Add them to your commit** (recommended):
```bash
git add GIT-FIX-PUSH.md GIT-PULL-AND-PUSH.bat GIT-FIX-BRANCH-PUSH.bat GIT-BRANCH-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md
git commit -m "Add git helper scripts"
git push origin feature/axis-labels-complete
```

**Or ignore them**:
Add to `.gitignore`:
```
GIT-*.bat
GIT-*.md
GIT-*.ps1
```

## Recommendation

**For v1.3.2 release, I recommend Option 1**:

1. Push to feature branch
2. Create Pull Request on GitHub
3. Merge to main

This gives you a clean history and ability to review before merging.

**Run this**:
```cmd
GIT-FIX-BRANCH-PUSH.bat
```
Choose Option 1, then go to GitHub and create the PR.
