# v1.3.0 Inherent Risk Display - FIX APPLIED ✅

## Issue Identified and Fixed

### ❌ **Previous Incorrect Behavior:**
- Inherent marker was positioned as a small offset from residual marker
- Both markers were in the SAME cell (residual cell)
- Arrow was very short (just a few pixels)
- Did not show actual risk movement across the matrix

### ✅ **Corrected Behavior:**
- Inherent marker is in its ORIGINAL cell (inherent L×C)
- Residual marker is in its CURRENT cell (residual L×C)
- Arrow goes FROM inherent cell TO residual cell
- Clearly shows risk movement across the matrix

## Visual Comparison

### Example: Risk-123 moves from (2,2) to (4,4)

**BEFORE (Wrong):**
```
Only Cell (4,4) shown:
┌────────────────┐
│  ○→●           │  ← Offset by 6px
│  Risk-123      │     Both in same cell
└────────────────┘
```

**AFTER (Correct):**
```
Cell (2,2):            Cell (4,4):
┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐
│    ○     │  ─────→  │    ●     │
│ Risk-123 │   Arrow  │ Risk-123 │
└──────────┘          └──────────┘

Inherent              Residual
(Where it started)    (Where it is now)
```

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. renderOrganizedLayout() - Complete Rewrite
**Old Approach:**
- Grouped risks by residual cell only
- Tried to show inherent as offset in same cell

**New Approach:**
```typescript
// Group by BOTH cells independently
const inherentCellMarkers = {};  // Group by inherent L×C
const residualCellMarkers = {};  // Group by residual L×C

// Organize in each cell separately
organizeMarkersInCell(inherentCellMarkers[cell], ...);
organizeMarkersInCell(residualCellMarkers[cell], ...);

// Track positions for arrows
organizedPositions[riskId].inherent = {x, y};
organizedPositions[riskId].residual = {x, y};

// Draw arrows between cells
drawArrow(inherent position → residual position);
```

### 2. renderSingleMarker() - New Simple Method
**Purpose:** Render ONE marker (either inherent OR residual)

**Inherent Marker (○):**
- Semi-transparent (opacity 0.5)
- Slightly smaller (size - 1)
- In its original cell
- Tooltip shows inherent L×C

**Residual Marker (●):**
- Full color (opacity 1.0)
- Full size
- In its current cell
- Tooltip shows residual L×C
- Has label

### 3. Arrow Logic - Separate Phase
**Old:** Arrows drawn during marker rendering
**New:** Arrows drawn after all markers positioned

Benefits:
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Can draw arrows across any distance
- Easier to toggle on/off

## Test Cases

Run: `node test-inherent-fix.js`

**Verifies:**
1. ✅ Separate cell grouping (inherent and residual)
2. ✅ Inherent markers organized in their cells
3. ✅ Residual markers organized in their cells
4. ✅ Position tracking for arrow endpoints
5. ✅ Arrows drawn between cells
6. ✅ Single marker rendering with types
7. ✅ Different appearance for inherent vs residual

## Real-World Example

### Portfolio of 3 Risks:

**Risk-A:** Likelihood 2, Consequence 2 → 4, 4
**Risk-B:** Likelihood 2, Consequence 2 → 3, 5
**Risk-C:** Likelihood 3, Consequence 3 → 3, 3 (no change)

**Visual Result:**
```
     L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
   ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
C5 │    │    │ ●B │    │    │
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
C4 │    │    │    │ ●A │    │
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
C3 │    │    │○C●C│    │    │  ← Risk-C no movement
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
C2 │    │○A  │    │    │    │
   │    │○B  │    │    │    │
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
C1 │    │    │    │    │    │
   └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘

Arrows:
• (2,2) → (4,4)  Risk-A improvement
• (2,2) → (3,5)  Risk-B  worsening
• No arrow for Risk-C (unchanged)
```

## Benefits of Fix

✅ **Accurate Visualization:** Shows true risk movement
✅ **Clear Communication:** Easy to see where risks came from
✅ **Portfolio Overview:** See patterns of improvement/worsening
✅ **Professional:** Matches risk management best practices
✅ **Scalable:** Works with any number of risks

## Verification Steps

1. **Compile:**
   ```cmd
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   Should compile without errors

2. **Test Logic:**
   ```cmd
   node test-inherent-fix.js
   ```
   All 7 tests should pass

3. **Package:**
   ```cmd
   npm run package
   ```
   Should create updated .pbiviz

4. **Test in Power BI:**
   - Import package
   - Add risk data with inherent ≠ residual
   - Enable "Show Inherent Risks"
   - Verify ○ in one cell, ● in another cell
   - Verify arrow connects them
