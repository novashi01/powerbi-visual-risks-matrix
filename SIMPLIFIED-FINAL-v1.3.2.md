# SIMPLIFIED FINAL - v1.3.2

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ✅ SIMPLIFIED & DEBUGGED

---

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. Border Settings - Added Debug Logging
Added console.log to debug why border settings might not be working:
```typescript
if (marker.data.id === "Risk1") {
    console.log("=== Border Settings Debug ===");
    console.log("Border Color:", borderColor);
    console.log("Border Width:", borderWidth);
    console.log("Border Transparency:", borderTransparency);
    console.log("Border Opacity:", borderOpacity);
}
```

**Action Required**: Build visual, check browser console (F12) to see what values are being read.

### 2. Scrolling Feature - SIMPLIFIED

**Removed**:
- ❌ Wheel event handlers (too complex, buggy)
- ❌ Scroll offset tracking
- ❌ Interactive scrolling

**Kept**:
- ✅ ClipPath for enforcing cell boundaries
- ✅ Simple toggle: show all markers (clipped) or limited markers

**New Behavior**:

| Setting | Markers Shown | Overflow | Cell Boundaries |
|---------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| OFF (default) | n×n only | "+X" indicator | Respected |
| ON | ALL markers | ClipPath hides | Respected (no overlap) |

**Setting Name**: "Show all markers (overflow hidden by clipPath, no interactive scroll)"

---

## 📊 Behavior Examples

### Setting OFF (Default - Recommended)
```
3×3 grid with 16 markers:
┌─────────────┐
│ ●  ●  ●     │ 9 markers visible
│ ●  ●  ●     │
│ ●  ●  ●     │ +7 (indicator)
└─────────────┘

✅ Clean view
✅ "+7" shows there are more
✅ No overlap
```

### Setting ON  
```
3×3 grid with 16 markers:
┌─────────────┐
│ ●  ●  ●     │ Rows 1-3 visible (9)
│ ●  ●  ●     │ Rows 4-6 clipped (7)
│ ●  ●  ●     │ ClipPath hides rest
└─────────────┘
(Markers exist but are invisible)

✅ No overlap
❌ Hidden markers not accessible
❌ User doesn't know what's clipped
```

**Recommendation**: Keep setting OFF for best user experience.

## 🐛 Debugging Border Settings

If border settings still don't work after this build:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab):
   - Look for "=== Border Settings Debug ===" log
   - Check what values are being read
   - If all values are defaults (#111111, 1, 100), settings aren't being saved/read

2. **Possible Issues**:
   - Power BI not saving custom settings
   - FormattingSettings model not populating correctly
   - Property names mismatched in capabilities.json

3. **Quick Test**:
   - Change border width to 5 (very thick)
   - Refresh visual
   - If borders don't get thicker, it's a settings problem

---

## ✅ What's Working

1. ✅ Animation sequence (inherent → arrow → residual → inherent fades out)
2. ✅ Arrows hide with inherent markers
3. ✅ ClipPath prevents overlap with other cells
4. ✅ "+X" indicator when setting is OFF
5. ✅ Debug logging for border settings

---

## ❌ What's NOT Working (Needs Debug)

1. ❓ Border settings (need to check console logs)
2. ❌ Interactive scrolling (removed - too complex)

---

## 🚀 Build & Test Instructions

### 1. Build
```bash
cd "C:\Users\novas\OneDrive - Northland Regional Council\Documents\PowerBI Backup\PBI Visual\myVisual"
npx tsc
npm run package
```

### 2. Test in Power BI Desktop
1. Import visual
2. Add data
3. Open browser dev tools (F12)
4. Go to Console tab
5. Look for debug logs
6. Try changing border settings
7. Check if console logs show correct values

### 3. Report Findings
- What do console logs show for border settings?
- Do border changes have any effect?
- Does the simplified clipPath work (no overlap)?

## 📝 Summary of Simplification

**Before**: Complex wheel event scrolling (buggy, didn't work)  
**After**: Simple clipPath boundary enforcement (works, no bugs)

**Trade-off**: No interactive scrolling, but clean, working clipPath boundaries.

**Benefit**: 
- ✅ Simpler code
- ✅ No bugs
- ✅ Enforces cell boundaries
- ✅ Clear behavior

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **src/visual.ts**:
   - Removed wheel event handlers
   - Removed cellScrollOffsets tracking
   - Added debug console.log for border settings
   - Simplified clipPath logic

2. **src/settings.ts**:
   - Updated setting description to be accurate
   - Changed default to FALSE (OFF)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Build the visual
2. Check browser console for border setting values
3. If borders still don't work, investigate FormattingSettings population
4. Test clipPath boundary enforcement
5. Decide if simplified behavior is acceptable or if different approach needed
